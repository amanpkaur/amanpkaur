# Hello, I'm Amanpreet Kaur ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Astrophysicist who solved astrophysical problems using data from telescopes (tabular and image). I employed python for all this work for my 13+ years in academia. During my research career of 6 years, I implemented machine learning methods for classification of astrophysical sources and classified 13% of the total unknown (33% total) using CART algorithms as well as Neural Networks. This was an innovation in my sub domain and my peer-reviewed [publications](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FKaur%2C%20A%2FKaur%2C%20A%22&filter_property_fq_property=AND&filter_property_fq_property=property%3A%22refereed%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_property%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FKaur%2C%20A%2FKaur%2C%20A%22)&fq_database=((database%3A%22astronomy%22)%20NOT%20database%3A%22physics%22)&fq_property=(property%3A%22refereed%22)&q=*%3A*%20author%3A%22Kaur%2C%20A.%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0) got highly cited.


This made me discover my own passion for data science and at present, I am looking and working on my portfolio to become a full time data scientist. I am based in Philadelphia, PA, USA. 

In short, I'm passionate about manipulating data to find meaningful insights! 
Needless to say, I still love the mysteries of our Universe and happy to talk about stars/black holes and planets to anyone. Oh, I also love gardening on our own Earth! ðŸŒ±

## ðŸš€ My Skills

- Data Analysis/Visualization with Python
- Machine Learning Models (Forecasting/Predicitve and Classification)

## ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Learning/Doing

- Working on a self identified machine learning project with an end-to-end implementation. I am collaborating with 3 people who I met through different platforms.
- Volunteering at Omdena for predicting the Unemployment Rate in Kenya
- Engaging in DIY Halloween decoration projects that showcase my creativity and earn the appreciation of my friendly neighbors.
